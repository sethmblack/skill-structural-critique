# Structural Critique

Trace individual problems to systemic causes and reframe blame from individuals to structures.

---

## When to Use

- Someone is being blamed for a problem that has systemic causes
- User says "Analyze this structurally" or "What system produces this?"
- Policy debates focus on individual behavior rather than structural conditions
- Need to shift conversation from "bad people" to "bad systems"
- Preparing advocacy that targets root causes rather than symptoms

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| problem | Yes | The individual symptom, failure, or suffering being examined |
| blamed_party | No | Who is currently being blamed (individual or group) |
| context | No | Relevant institutional, economic, or political backdrop |
| desired_reframe | No | What structural cause should be highlighted |

---

## The Three-Step Method

### Step 1: Identify the Individual Symptom

What specific problem is being discussed? How is it currently framed?

**Look for:**
- Individual failures ("lazy workers," "bad parents," "criminals")
- Personal responsibility framing ("they should have...")
- Moral judgments on individuals ("these people are...")

**Ask:** Who is being blamed? What behavior is being condemned?

### Step 2: Trace to Systemic Cause

Follow the symptom upstream. What structures produce this outcome?

**Categories of systemic causes:**
- **Economic structures:** Who benefits financially from this arrangement? Who is harmed?
- **Legal structures:** What laws create or maintain this problem?
- **Institutional structures:** What organizations have incentives aligned with this outcome?
- **Social structures:** What norms, expectations, or arrangements make this inevitable?
- **Historical structures:** What past decisions created current conditions?

**The Goldman Question:** "If one person does it, it's a character flaw. If millions do it, it's a system."

### Step 3: Reframe Responsibility

Shift the argument from individual blame to structural critique.

**The reframe formula:**
- "The problem isn't [individual behavior], it's [systemic cause]"
- "We're told to blame [scapegoat], but the real cause is [structure]"
- "[Individual symptom] is what happens when [system] operates as designed"

**Key insight:** Systems produce predictable outcomes. If you want different outcomes, change the system—not the individuals caught in it.

## Analysis Framework

When examining any social problem structurally:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Who profits from this arrangement? | Identify economic incentives maintaining the problem |
| Who makes the rules? | Identify power structures governing the situation |
| What would have to change for this to stop happening? | Identify leverage points for structural change |
| Is this a new problem or has it always existed? | Understand historical roots |
| Who gets blamed? Who escapes blame? | Identify ideological function of current framing |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Structural Critique: [Problem Name]

### The Individual Framing
[How the problem is currently described—who is blamed, what behavior is condemned]

### The Systemic Analysis

#### Economic Structure
[Who profits, what financial incentives maintain the problem]

#### Legal/Political Structure
[What laws and policies create the conditions]

#### Institutional Structure
[What organizations have interests in maintaining status quo]

#### Social/Historical Structure
[What norms, past decisions, or social arrangements contribute]

### The Reframe
[How to talk about this problem structurally instead of individually]

### Talking Points
- [Point 1: Systemic cause]
- [Point 2: Evidence of structural rather than individual causation]
- [Point 3: What would actually fix this]

### Counter-Arguments Anticipated
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Personal responsibility matters" | [How to acknowledge without ceding the structural point] |
| "You can't blame the system" | [How systems produce predictable outcomes] |

### Call to Action
[What structural change should be demanded]
```

---

## Constraints

- Never excuse genuine individual wrongdoing by over-blaming systems—both can be true
- The structural analysis must be grounded in evidence, not assumed
- Acknowledge complexity—most problems have multiple structural causes
- Don't remove all agency from individuals—people aren't just puppets of structure
- The goal is better understanding, not just shifting blame

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "People keep saying homeless individuals are lazy and should just get jobs. How do I respond structurally?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Structural Critique: Homelessness

### The Individual Framing
"Homeless people are lazy." "They should just get jobs." "They chose this lifestyle." "If they really wanted to work, they could."

Blamed parties: Individual homeless people
Condemned behavior: Perceived laziness, addiction, mental illness, bad choices

### The Systemic Analysis

#### Economic Structure
- Housing costs have risen 150% since 1980; median wages have risen 20%
- Minimum wage full-time work cannot afford a one-bedroom apartment in any US state
- Profit incentives drive housing as investment, not shelter—vacancy is often more profitable than affordable occupancy
- Healthcare costs bankrupt thousands annually; medical debt is a leading cause of homelessness

#### Legal/Political Structure
- Zoning laws restrict affordable housing construction
- Cuts to mental health funding since the 1980s closed institutions without community alternatives
- Criminalization of homelessness (anti-camping laws, hostile architecture) addresses symptoms, not causes
- Tax policy incentivizes real estate speculation over housing stability

#### Institutional Structure
- Banks profit from high housing prices
- Employers benefit from desperate labor pool
- Private prisons benefit from criminalization
- Pharmaceutical industry profits from addiction treatment, not prevention

#### Social/Historical Structure
- Deinstitutionalization without community mental health investment
- Destruction of public housing since the 1970s
- Stagnant wages despite productivity growth
- Social safety net deliberately weakened since Reagan era

### The Reframe
"People don't become homeless because they're lazy. They become homeless because housing costs more than wages can cover. When millions of full-time workers can't afford a one-bedroom apartment, that's not a character flaw—that's a policy choice."

### Talking Points
- A full-time minimum wage worker can't afford rent in any US state. Are millions of people simultaneously lazy, or is the wage inadequate?
- The number of homeless people correlates directly with housing cost-to-income ratios. It's math, not morals.
- Most homeless adults have work histories. Job loss + one medical crisis + high rent = homelessness. Three months of bad luck shouldn't equal life on the street.
- If "getting a job" solved homelessness, we wouldn't have employed homeless people. But we do—25% of homeless people are working.

### Counter-Arguments Anticipated
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Personal responsibility matters" | Agreed—and it's the personal responsibility of voters and policymakers to build a system where full-time work guarantees housing. |
| "Addiction causes homelessness" | For some. But addiction rates are similar across housed and unhoused populations. What differs is the safety net. |
| "They chose to live this way" | 96% of homeless people want housing. "Choice" requires options. |

### Call to Action
Demand: Affordable housing policy—rent control, public housing investment, zoning reform
Demand: Living wage legislation
Demand: Mental health and addiction services funding
Frame: "Stop criminalizing poverty. Start building housing."

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Emma Goldman** expert persona. Goldman understood that individual suffering almost always has structural causes: "Ask for work. If they don't give you work, ask for bread. If they don't give you bread, take bread." Her structural analysis moved from individual problems to systemic demands—not charity for the poor, but changes to the systems that create poverty.
